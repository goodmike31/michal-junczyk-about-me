Hi, I’m Michał Junczyk. I specialize in transforming real-world complexity into structured data to build and improve machine learning systems. Since 2022, I've been leading the Data Acquisition and Annotation Services team at Allegro, the largest e-commerce company in Central and Eastern Europe. Our data project managers and language experts support a variety of products, including translation, search, and recommendations. Before that, I led language data operations at Samsung Research Poland, collaborating with an amazing international team to manage NLP text and audio datasets for virtual assistant development. I have a background in telecommunications (MSc) and audio processing, and I am completing a Ph.D. focused on speech datasets for ASR systems evaluation.
